This dataset exists for free on the web. Link to the dataset is : https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572\n",

A farmers' market is often defined as a public site used by two or more local or regional producers for the direct sale of farm products to consumers. In addition to fresh fruits and vegetables, markets may sell dairy products, fish, meat, baked goods, and other minimally processed foods.\n",
